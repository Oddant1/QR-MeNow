# 1. Introduction
QR-MeNow is your new personal business card. Swapping contact information can be an
arduous process that is prone to human error. To help simplify the process QR-MeNow uses QR codes
to store and share arbitrary contact information including but not limited to: LinkedIn,
phone numbers, email addresses, social media, personal websites and more. Your personal QR
code can be configured to only be valid for a limited amount of time or a limited number
of uses, or to only display the pertinent contact information for the situation.

# 2. Initial Value Proposition and Consumer Segments
## 2.1. Initial Value Proposition
Free time these days is severly limited, don't waste yours typing in contact information

and use it to share all of your information as many times as you want.
## 2.2. Initial Consumer Segments
- Busy people
- People with a lot of contact information
- Small businesses
- People with a lot of social media
